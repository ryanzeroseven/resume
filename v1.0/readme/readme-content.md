## reflections

Im not a designer, im a builder
I bought a course on Udemy from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>, called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/">Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</a>, about a year ago and was finally able to do it this December.
While I was learning on the job to become a Mendix developer, the project I started in used Mendix mostly for Front-End stuff. I had never done anything related to developing, coding or building and most I learned about styling was done on the job and asking my seniors. Gradually I came to know about css, sass and javascript.
I was able to write css but never understood what and why I was writing it. Unfortunately the pace of the project was high and I didnt bother making time to learn more. So my goal for 2022 was to get at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS so I could also better build pages in Mendix.
After the course I felt like I knew a lot more and understood the basic things of building a webpage from scratch. I couldn't just leave it there and start the next course, I had to build something for myself as well. How could I not want to put my new knowledge to use?
It took me 2 weeks to get through the course and 3 weeks to build the website. I am not a designer, I am a builder. I took a lot of inspiration from the Omnifood project we did in the course and from another dev (aniqa) I came to know about via the Discord server of Jonas.

What I learned is basic understanding of how HTML and CSS work, some best practices and the power of styling.

What I still lack:

- I need better understading about Flexbox and Grid. I get the basics but I feel that I'm not fully utilizing both.
- JavaScript, animations make websites nowadays. A static page isn't attractive.
- My knowledge on CSS properties is limited to what I learned from the course and ideas I got from look at other websites. If I aim to be more creative and solution driven, I need more exerpience to know which properties there are for me to use.
