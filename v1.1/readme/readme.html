                I stay by my words: I'm not a designer, I'm a builder
              </p>

              <p>
                Once again I got confronted with the fact that I'm not a
                designer but a builder. Show me what it needs to look like and
                I'll gladly build it but ask me to be creative out of the blue
                is time consuming and proved to be a bit demotivating. I didn't
                change anything about the structure of the page but I did come
                up with new interactions on the page not just for desktops and
                laptops but also tablets and phones. Structuring these added
                content took longer then expected. Along the way I tried to
                check on the points I was still lacking and see if it was
                possible to lack-less... I haven't done anything new with
                Flexbox or Grid but I did use new Javascript to for example make
                a sticky navigation and mobile navigation. Some new CSS tricks
                like building an accordion or using backdrop-filter. So yes I
                lack-less, about 2%...maybe. Going through my own project again
                after not touching it for a week after its first release was
                confusing at times. I forgot why something was coded that way
                and thats not a positive sign. Main focus of this v1.1 was to
                get it out for smaller screen sizes but in doing so I know now I
                really need to put in comments. So that when I do look back, I
                know why something was coded that way or not. <br />
                I learned a bit more about different animations and JavaScript
                but also about performances.

                I bought a course on Udemy from
                <a

                  class="link"
                  >Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</a
                >, about a year ago and was finally able to do it this December.
                While I was learning on the job to become a Mendix developer,
                the project I started in used Mendix mostly for Front-End stuff.
                I had never done anything related to developing, coding or
                building and most I learned about styling was done on the job
                and asking my seniors. Gradually I came to know about HTML, CSS,
                SASS and JavaScript. <br />
                I was able to write CSS but never understood what and why I was
                writing it. Unfortunately the pace of the project was high and I
                didnt bother making time to learn more. So my goal for 2022 was
                to get at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS so I could
                also better build pages in Mendix. <br id="lacking" />
                After the course I felt like I knew a lot more and understood
                the basic things of building a webpage from scratch. I couldn't
                just leave it there and start the next course, I had to build
                something for myself as well. How could I not want to put my new
                knowledge to use? It took me 2 weeks to get through the course
                and 3 weeks to build the website. I am not a designer, I am a
                builder. I took a lot of inspiration from the Omnifood project
                we did in the course and from another dev
                <a href="https://www.aniqa.dev/" class="link"> Aniqa</a>, I came
                to know about via the Discord server of Jonas. <br />
                What I learned is basic understanding of how HTML and CSS work,
                some best practices and the power of styling.
              </p>
              <p class="strong">What I still lack:</p>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>
                  &mdash; I need better understading about Flexbox and Grid. I
                  get the basics but I feel that I'm not fully utilizing both.
                </li>
                <li>
                  &mdash; JavaScript knowledge to create animations. A static
                  page isn't attractive.

                <li>
                  &mdash; Knowledge on CSS properties. Mine is limited to what I
                  learned from the course and ideas I got from looking at other
                  websites. If I aim to be more creative and solution driven, I
                  need more exerpience to know which properties there are for me
                  to use.
